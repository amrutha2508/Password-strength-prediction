# ABSTRACT
This project endeavors to create a machine learning model with the objective of predicting password strength, categorizing user-generated passwords into weak, normal, and strong classes based on semantic analysis. The study employs techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization to transform password text into a machine-readable format. Logistic regression serves as the chosen classifier in this endeavor. The aim is to enhance password security through the accurate classification of password strengths.
